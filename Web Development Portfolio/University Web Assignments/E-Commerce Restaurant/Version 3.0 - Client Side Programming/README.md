Here are some following steps ensure the website works properly.

1\. Make sure that XAMPP is turned on, with both Apache and SQL

2\. There are limitations with the csv thus far due to the time limit I
have left

3\. All the JS functionalities work but storing the data. Hopefully in
the final project, I will be applying a full working csv data storage
