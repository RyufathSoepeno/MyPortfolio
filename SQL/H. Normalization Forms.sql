/** Let's consider a table Employees that stores information about employees in a company. 
Each employee has a unique employee_id, and each department has a unique department_id. */

/* Imagine you have a big box of colorful marbles, and you want to organize them neatly. 
Each marble has a unique pattern, but some patterns might repeat. 
You want to make sure you can find any marble easily without digging through the whole box.

Normalization in a database is like sorting those marbles. 
It's a process where you organize information in a way that reduces messiness and repetition. 
You break down information into smaller parts and arrange them in a logical order. 
This makes it easier to find and manage data without wasting time.

/** 
Functional and non-functional dependencies are concepts often used in the context of database design and data modeling. Let me explain these terms in simple, layman's terms:

**Functional Dependency:**
Think of functional dependency like a cause-and-effect relationship. 
In a database, it means that the value of one attribute (or column) uniquely determines the value of another attribute. 
If you know the value of A, you can always figure out the value of B. 
For example, in a database of students, the student's ID (A) could uniquely determine their name (B).

**Non-Functional Dependency:**
Non-functional dependency is the opposite. It means there isn't a clear cause-and-effect relationship between two attributes. 
Knowing the value of A doesn't necessarily allow you to determine the value of B. In the same student database, if you know the student's name (A), 
it doesn't necessarily tell you their ID (B), because many students might have the same name.

So, in a nutshell, functional dependency is about one attribute directly influencing another, while non-functional dependency is when there's no direct relationship between attributes. Understanding these dependencies helps in designing databases that are organized, accurate, and efficient.
