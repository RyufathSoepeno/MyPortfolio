/**In an inner join, only the rows that have matching values in both tables are included in the result set. 
Here's what happens to the rows in an inner join:

Matching Rows: When a row from the left table (specified before the INNER JOIN keyword) has a matching value in the right table 
(specified after the INNER JOIN keyword) based on the join condition, that row is included in the result set.

Non-Matching Rows: Rows that do not have matching values in both tables are excluded from the result set. 
These non-matching rows are not considered in the join and are not included in the final output.

Basically, they are the defaults of all joins
