|Technical Writing for Eco-Smart House| <br> Provided Technical Writing for an Eco Smart House project for Waingapu in a group of 5 members (without a leader) for "Technical Writing" class. As Head of Technology, task involved drawing layouts and diagrams for the Eco Smart House and how it is planned to look like. With a budget of not over 2 million Rupiah, we proposed on building an eco-friendly smart housing system that implements advanced technology that is efficient, convenient, and comfortable with a source of green energy. This initiative aims to provide a comfortable and healthy living environment that can adapt to future challenges for the residents of Waingapu <br> <br> | Microsoft 365, Autodesk, Edrawmax | ![House Drawing](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/assets/89006072/f80f92b5-ebf2-4055-9385-10bbb6b3d527) ![House Layout](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/assets/89006072/b0dc52ea-5791-4e12-b022-c89c29c35877) | <ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9EY4duaJTq6PjdEhQ2kMtlEN44DJMD9gPk8ZDwkF68/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Proposal</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Euk7r4_38Rf7s8nOoI12NQACBgSVM0_acrxSyvx9lc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Presentation</a></li></ul>|
|Network Analysis with Python| <br> The Python script for "Introduction to Network Analysis" course employed the subprocess module to execute system commands, utilizing the platform-specific ‘arp’ command on Windows, Linux, or macOS to retrieve the ARP table. By calling this command, the script captures information about ARP entries, including MAC addresses and associated IP addresses. This approach enables network administrators to quickly detect anomalies, such as incorrect ARP entries or potential spoofing activities, allowing for timely troubleshooting and mitigation in hybrid network environments <br> <br> | Python | ![screenshot-1709804539491](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/assets/89006072/9f56e23a-8790-4320-bf49-cbe865f11135) | <ul><li><a href="https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Network%20Analysis%20with%20Python/ARP.py" target="_blank">Code</a></li><li><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1R4-v8Po7kcjTuILZpPka5qKpZkJKC1JF/view?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Document</a></li></ul>|
|Tracker App| <br> Created a tracker app/program using Java for "Object Oriented Programming" course. The app operates by placing a dot that moves randomly within a locally designed map (created without a map framework but with a map design within a Java window). Each time the dot intersects with a square representing a building, the color of the square changes, indicating that the person is inside that building <br> <br> | Java | ![Screenshot 2024-03-18 162629](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/assets/89006072/dc209da3-b836-4440-9d2e-d2bcc6dfc5c0)![Screenshot 2024-03-18 162644](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/assets/89006072/892f6402-6e38-40b3-8811-bcba1c1fe006) | [Link](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/blob/main/Tracker%20App%20with%20Java/Navigator.java) |
