As Head of Technology, task involved drawing layouts and diagrams for the Eco Smart House and how it is planned to look like. With a budget of not over 2 million Rupiah, we proposed on building an eco-friendly smart housing system that implements advanced technology that is efficient, convenient, and comfortable with a source of green energy. This initiative aims to provide a comfortable and healthy living environment that can adapt to future challenges for the residents of Waingapu <br> <br> | Microsoft 365, Autodesk, Edrawmax | K | <ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1A9EY4duaJTq6PjdEhQ2kMtlEN44DJMD9gPk8ZDwkF68/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Proposal</a></li><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/11Euk7r4_38Rf7s8nOoI12NQACBgSVM0_acrxSyvx9lc/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Presentation</a></li></ul>|
|Network Analysis with Python| <br> The Python script for "Introduction to Network Analysis" course employed the subprocess module to execute system commands, utilizing the platform-specific ‘arp’ command on Windows, Linux, or macOS to retrieve the ARP table. By calling this command, the script captures information about ARP entries, including MAC addresses and associated IP addresses. This approach enables network administrators to quickly detect anomalies, such as incorrect ARP entries or potential spoofing activities, allowing for timely troubleshooting and mitigation in hybrid network environments <br> <br> | Python | K | [Link](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/tree/main/Network%20Analysis%20with%20Python)|

|College Course Administration| <br> Created a College Course Administrated system that can insert the number of courses a student took in a semester using stack and number keys. The system allows the user to input scores for each course and calculates the GPA, accumulating the cumulative GPA for the student. Additionally, it offers functionalities to add and apply new courses based on the total GPA and eligible credit, utilizing arrays to prevent duplicate course selection. The main menu provides options to display, delete, and sort courses, with seamless navigation between different functionalities. The system ensures efficient management of student courses and provides a comprehensive platform for academic administration. <br> <br> | C++ | K | [Link](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/tree/main/College%20Course%20Administration)|
|Scientific Calculator| <br> Created a Scientific Calculator that can perform basic arithmetic operations (+ - / :) and trigonometric functions (sin cos tan), alongside advanced functions like square root, exponential, logarithm, and natural logarithm. This calculator accommodates input for up to 10 or more variables and parameters, enabling complex calculations beyond simple arithmetic. Implemented using class functions and incorporating linked list or queue functions, it also features history management capabilities for deletion and retrieval, ensuring a comprehensive and efficient user experience. <br> <br> | C++ | K | [Link](https://github.com/RyufathSoepeno/MyPortfolio/tree/main/Scientific%20Calculator)|
