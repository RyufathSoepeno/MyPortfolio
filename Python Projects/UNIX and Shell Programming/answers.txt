Note: I am using gitbash to solve both sections 1 and 2

1.1 What do the following commands do?
You can use command “man” to check the command description.
cd ps ps -u $(whoami)
kill

Answer: It will print out this result shown in quote
“Line1: cd: too many arguments
Kill: usage: kill [-s sigspec | -n signum | -sigspec] pid | jobspec … or kill -l [sigspec]”

Supposedly, “ps” lists the currently running processes, but supposedly because we used it twice, the “cd” in gitbash will believe it consisted of too many arguments

And "kill" sends the message to terminate the entire process, as outputted above






1.2 What does the following script do?
myvar=0
	while [ $myvar -le 10 ]
	do
		echo $myvar
		myvar=$(( $myvar + 1 ))
	done


Answer: It will print out this result
0 + 1
1 + 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 + 1
5 + 1
6 + 1
7 + 1
8 + 1
9 + 1
10 + 1

This is because it is producing an iteration loop in increment, starting with myvar's value of 0, until the value is greater than 10 






1.3 What does the following script do?
for myfile in ../?????? do
	if [ -d "$myfile" ]
	then echo "$myfile (dir)"
	else echo "$myfile"
	fi done


Answer:  First, before we get to the supposed answer, it would print out a syntax error. 

The code should have been written like this if the correct answer was not an error:
for myfile in ../??????; do
    if [ -d "$myfile" ]; then
        echo "$myfile (dir)"
    else
        echo "$myfile"
    fi
done


Moving on, if the expected answer in not an error, and if we followed the code I have fixed, this would be printed out 
“../Public (dir)”

It correctly corresponds to the if statement. 
The script iterates through directories in the parent directory using a wildcard pattern "../??????", where "?" represents any single character. It checks each directory found using the "-d" test in the if statement. In the given result, it prints "../Public (dir)" because it found a directory in my gitbash named "Public" in my parent directory.
